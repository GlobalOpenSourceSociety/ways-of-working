# Ways of working for respect

All ideas are considered.

All voices are heard.

Presume good-faith intentions.

Test assumptions and inferences.

Debate the issue, not the person.

Critique the idea, not the proposer.

Challenge one another respectfully.

Silence does not mean agreement nor disagreement.

Aim to understand each others' strengths and also weaknesses.

If you are confused by something, ask questions as soon as possible.

If you are offended by something, acknowledge it as soon as possible.

Aggression or personal attacks are not ok, and will be halted immediately.

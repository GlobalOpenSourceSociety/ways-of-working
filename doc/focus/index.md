# Ways of working for focus

Focus is limited so budget it wisely.

Focus yourself and your team with practices such as 
[TEAM FOCUS](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/team-focus),
[OKR](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives-and-key-results),
[SBS](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/strategic-balanced-scorecard),
[VSM](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/value-stream-mapping),
[GIST](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/goals-ideas-steps-tasks),
[SMART](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/smart-criteria),
etc.

Designate times and places for louder/bigger work and quieter/smaller work.

Decide on team indicators that mean "do not disturb" then respect them.

Focus can be improved via mindfulness meditation and breathing exercises.

Focus can be improved via occasional breaks.

Try the Pomodoro technique. Set a timer so you do 25 minutes of focused work, then set a timer so you do 5 minutes of break. After four rounds, set a timer so you do a longer break of 30 minutes.

Try the Dash techniques. A time-based dash example is "I will work on this for 1 hour" or "I will work on this until 11:00". A unit-based dash example is "I will write 5 pages of my document" or "I will complete 20% of my weekly quota".

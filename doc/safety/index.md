# Ways of working for safety and reliability

Each teammate knows what to do if another teamate is absent, including who handles what, how, when, and why.

When there's an issue, then we have a way to triage it, handle it, learn from it, and improve because of it.

Each of our significant projects has a risk log, and its kept up to date.

When we have dangerous setups, we use lockout/tagout.

We use backups that match our planned level of risk, and we verify the backups work.
